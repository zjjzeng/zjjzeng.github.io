I am a bachelor student in the School of Software at Northwestern Polytechnical University. Currently, I am working as a research assistant in State Key Laboratory of Speech & Image Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an. Prior to this, I graduated from Yiling High School of Hubei in 2016.

My primiary research interests contain computer vision, object detection, image identification, crowd counting, deep learning and computer graphics. I have some practical experience in these mentioned areas during my internship in the State Key Lab of Speech & Image Information Processing. In addition, I am also willing to explore new topics including but not limited to all subfileds of computer vision or machine learning.

I am looking for MS program in the fields of computer science in United States. If you think I match your group, please contact me via [email](mailto:zengjia@mail.nwpu.edu.cn) at any moment.
