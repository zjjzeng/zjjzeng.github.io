<br>Yichang is my hometown, I lived in this lovely city for 18 years before I went to Xi'an for university study. I love the customs, scenerys and food in Yichang. Of course, I also won't forget my friends here. To summary in one word, "beautiful hills, beautiful water, and more beautiful people", Yichang deserves it.
